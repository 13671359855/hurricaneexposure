\title{Hurricane exposure by wind for communities}
\usage{
multi_county_wind(communities, start_year, end_year, wind_limit)
}
\arguments{
\item{communities}{A dataframe with the FIPS codes for all counties within
each community. It must include columns with a column identifier
(\code{commun}) and with the FIPS codes of counties included in each
community (\code{fips}). See the example code.}

\item{start_year}{Four-digit integer with first year to consider.}

\item{end_year}{Four-digit integer with last year to consider.}

\item{wind_limit}{A numeric vector of length one giving the minimum
wind speed (in meters per second) to use in the filter}
}
\value{
Returns the same type dataframe as \code{county_rain},
   but with storms listed by community instead of county.
}
\description{
This function takes a dataframe with multi-county communities and returns a
community-level dataframe of "exposed" storms, based on the highest of the
maximum sustained wind speed for each county in the community.
